# NHL-Salaries
Predicting NHL Player Salaries from the 2023-2024 season using on-ice metrics. This is an extension of my Statistics capstone project where I used the same data to predict NHL Salaries while mostly using Regression models for higher interpretability. What makes this project different is I am splitting my data into training and test sets and am more focused on predictability than interpretability. The original project was done solely in R and this project will be done using Python. The dataset I will be using was created in R as I am more familiar with web scraping and data cleaning in R.
